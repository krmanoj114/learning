>Principle of Object-Oriented Programming:
Question: What are the principles of object-oriented programming, and how do they enhance software development?
Answer: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is based on four core principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
 These principles promote modular, reusable, and maintainable code. Encapsulation hides the internal implementation details of objects,
 inheritance allows for code reuse and specialization, polymorphism enables the use of objects interchangeably, and abstraction focuses 
 on creating simplified models of complex systems.
